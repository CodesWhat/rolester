# Rolester — agentic job-search workspace
# Zero runtime dependencies; node:24-slim is sufficient for all core CLIs.

# NOTE: playwright (used by capture scripts) is a devDependency and is NOT
# installed in this image. If you need capture scripts, run them outside the
# container or build a separate image with:
#   RUN npm ci --include=dev && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
