# Apply drydock-style branch protection to CodesWhat/rolester `main` (via a ruleset).
#
# Mirrors drydock's "Main branch protection" ruleset: require a PR with 2 approvals,
# dismiss stale reviews on push, code-owner review, last-push approval, block force-push,
# block deletion, no bypass for anyone.
#
# Deliberately OMITS two of drydock's rules until rolester has the matching infra:
#   - required_status_checks (drydock gates on Build/Lint/Test/E2E) — rolester has no
#     PR CI yet and the suite is red; requiring checks that never pass blocks all merges.
#   - code_scanning (CodeQL) — not enabled on rolester yet.
# Add both back here once a green PR CI workflow + CodeQL are in place.
#
# Run:  bash scripts/protect-main.sh
