# ingest-messages

> **Runs under AGENTS.md.** These contracts bind without being restated here: Privacy Invariant (`current_base` never outbound), Honesty Firewall, Placeholder/Bracket Ban, Gate Write-back, Domain-Neutral Rule, Browser Automation Contract, Activity Pulse logging, Tracker verify+re-render, and Sent-Clears-Draft. Inline reminders at point-of-use are intentional; standalone restatements point back to the relevant AGENTS.md section.

## STEP 0 — CONSENT GATE (hard stop)

This is the highest ToS-exposure capability in the automation stack. Messaging
automation most directly risks a platform's terms of service — the consent gate
here is the most explicit in the system. Never open a browser or touch any platform
until consent is confirmed.

Run:

```
npm run automation -- status --json
```

Inspect the `capabilities.messaging` entry. The applicable platforms are `linkedin`
and `wellfound`. For each platform, `allowed: true` means all three conditions are
simultaneously true: the `messaging` capability global switch is on, that platform's
per-capability switch is on, and the platform's one-time ToS consent is recorded.
This is the three-part AND from `mayRun()` in `src/core/automation/consent.mjs` —
never re-derive it in prose.

If **no platform** shows `allowed: true`, explain exactly how to opt in, then
stop — do not open a browser:

1. Read the platform's terms of service yourself to confirm automated messaging reads
   are permitted.
2. Record consent: `npm run automation -- consent <platform> --write`
3. Enable the capability global switch: `npm run automation -- enable messaging --write`
4. Enable for the specific platform: `npm run automation -- enable messaging <platform> --write`
5. Verify: `npm run automation -- status --json`

State clearly: this capability is OFF by default; enabling it is a deliberate choice.
The user must read the platform ToS themselves before recording consent — Rolester
records the decision but does not make it.

This skill is always user-initiated. Never run it unprompted or on a schedule.

## STEP 1 — LOAD WATERMARK + COMPUTE WINDOW

Read `workspace/tracker.json`. For each platform that showed `allowed: true` in STEP 0,
find the entry in `sources[]` whose `id` is `"linkedin-messages"` or
`"wellfound-messages"` respectively. If the entry exists and has a `lastRunAt` value,
use that ISO-8601 date-time as the lookback threshold for that platform. If no such
entry exists or `lastRunAt` is absent, default the window to 14 days back.

Log the resolved window per platform before proceeding:

```
Scanning LinkedIn messages received after <resolved-threshold>.
Scanning Wellfound messages received after <resolved-threshold>.
```

Proceed only with platforms that are both allowed and in scope. Skip any platform
that is not `allowed: true` and note the reason.

## STEP 2 — OPEN THE MESSAGES INBOX IN THE SESSION BROWSER

For each allowed platform, navigate to that platform's messages or DM inbox URL in
the session browser. The session browser is Layer 3 per `docs/BROWSER.md`: prefer
the Chrome extension (it already holds the user's logins), fall back to a Playwright
persistent profile the user has signed into once
(`~/.rolester/board-profiles/<platform>`).

Before reading anything, snapshot or read the current page state. Drive the live DOM
turn-by-turn. Never rely on hardcoded selectors — the same model as `apply-job`.

If you encounter a login wall, captcha, 2FA prompt, or any unexpected interstitial at
any point, halt immediately and ask the user to complete it. Do not attempt to bypass
or automate around any auth challenge.

Save any screenshot or scraped page fragment under `workspace/` only.

## STEP 3 — READ MESSAGE METADATA

Within the inbox, scroll to surface threads active within the window resolved in
STEP 1. For each visible thread, capture — without opening the thread body:

- Correspondent name and/or handle
- Correspondent headline / title and any thread badge (recruiter / talent / hiring /
  InMail / Jobs / Sponsored / Promoted) when surfaced in the list — this is the
  recruiting-relevance signal consumed in STEP 4
- Thread subject or first-message snippet
- Most-recent message timestamp
- Thread ID or URL (to return for full body if matched)
- Direction of the most-recent message (inbound / outbound — infer from position or
  sender name vs. the candidate's own account name)

Do NOT pull full message bodies yet. Collect only enough metadata to classify
recruiting-relevance and match threads to tracker applications in STEP 4.

## STEP 4 — MATCH TO TRACKER

Read `workspace/tracker.json` (already loaded in STEP 1). Also read
`candidate/targeting.yml` for `excluded_companies` and any company/domain signals
relevant at match time.

For each thread from STEP 3, attempt matching in priority order:

1. Correspondent name vs. `communications[].messages[].from` / `messages[].to` on
   any existing application record.
2. Company name extracted from the thread subject or snippet vs. application `company`
   field.
3. Thread subject vs. existing `communications[].subject` on any application.

Apply a two-sided relevance classification BEFORE escalating anything to the user — the
human gate is for "real recruiter, which application?", never for "is this even a job thread?":

**Negative pre-filter** — auto-skip threads whose subject / snippet / sender match obvious
non-recruiting patterns: marketing, event invite, newsletter, sponsored / promoted, or a
clearly personal or networking exchange with no job signal.

**Positive relevance test** — for every remaining unmatched thread, decide whether it is
plausibly recruiting-related from the STEP 3 signals: a recruiter / talent / hiring sender
headline, an InMail or Jobs badge, or role / opportunity / interview / screening / offer /
JD language in the snippet. A thread with NONE of these signals and no tracker match is
auto-skipped as non-recruiting — do NOT put it in the user table. (A 1st-degree connection
sending a casual reply with no job content is the canonical auto-skip; the agent classifies
it, it does not ask the user about it.)

Only escalate threads that PASS the positive test (look recruiting-related) yet cannot be
auto-matched to an existing application — e.g. a recruiter for a company not yet tracked, or
an ambiguous match across two applications. When relevance is genuinely unclear from metadata
alone, ONE lightweight body peek is permitted to classify (read-only, for classification only,
never ingestion); if still unclear, escalate.

Log every auto-skip (both negative-filter and non-recruiting) so the user sees what was
dropped and why. Then collect only the escalated unmatched / ambiguous threads into a
numbered table:

```
#  | Platform  | Correspondent        | Subject / snippet                      | Date
---|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------
1  | linkedin  | Jane Smith           | "Following up on your application..."  | 2026-06-10
2  | wellfound | Alex Rivera          | "Intro from Acme Engineering team"     | 2026-06-09
```

Ask the user to supply the application ID for each numbered row or type `skip`.
Do not proceed to STEP 5 for any thread until it is either matched or explicitly
skipped.

## STEP 5 — PULL BODIES FOR MATCHED THREADS ONLY

**[DELEGATE: subagent — sequential]** Thread body-pulls drive the session browser, so they
run **one at a time** per the one-browser rule — delegation here buys per-thread context
isolation, not parallelism. Each subagent reads its matched thread and returns the
chronological messages; the orchestrator captures them to `communications[]` (sole tracker
writer). The STEP 0 consent gate already ran on the orchestrator. See the **Delegation
Contract** in AGENTS.md.

For each confirmed match from STEP 4, navigate to that thread in the session browser
and read the full message bodies within the lookback window. Snapshot the page before
reading. Capture all individual messages in the thread in chronological order:
direction, timestamp, sender name, and body text.

If the full thread text is long (over ~1,500 characters), ensure the directory exists
first then save the body:

```bash
mkdir -p workspace/comms
```

Write the thread to `workspace/comms/<company-slug>-<threadId>.md` and record the
path as `artifactPath`. Short bodies may be stored inline in `summary`.

Never write message body content anywhere outside `workspace/`. Never transmit it
outbound. Never send any message, reply, or reaction — this skill is read-only on
the platform.

## STEP 6 — CAPTURE TO TRACKER

For each confirmed-matched thread, update `workspace/tracker.json` directly.

Find or create the `communications[]` record with fields:
`id`, `applicationId`, `company`, `role`, `status`, `summary`.

Set `channel` based on platform:
- LinkedIn threads → `channel: "linkedin"`
- Wellfound threads → `channel: "portal"`

Both enum values exist in `config/tracker.schema.json`; no schema change is needed.

For each individual message in the thread (within the lookback window), append to
`communications[].messages[]` a message object with this exact shape (per the locked
schema in foundations-spec §4):

```json
{
  "id": "msg-<appId>-<n>",
  "direction": "inbound",
  "at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "from": "<sender-name-or-handle>",
  "to": ["<recipient-name-or-handle>"],
  "subject": "<thread subject or first-line snippet>",
  "summary": "<concise gist — do NOT include current_base>",
  "artifactPath": "<workspace/comms/... or empty string>"
}
```

For outbound messages in the thread (sent by the candidate), set `"direction":
"outbound"`.

Update the parent `communications[]` record fields as follows — all in **one write**
(partial writes leave ghost CTAs):

- **status transition (required):** if the last captured message in this thread is
  `direction: inbound`, set `status → needs-reply`; if the last captured message is
  `direction: outbound` and no inbound message follows it, set `status → waiting`.
- **nextActionDue null-first rule:** if the matched comm record previously had
  `status: waiting` (candidate was awaiting a recruiter reply) and an inbound message
  now arrives, **set `nextActionDue → null` first** (the expected event has occurred),
  then set a new `nextActionDue` for the candidate's reply window (72 h from the
  inbound message timestamp, unless the message implies urgency — e.g. "let me know
  by EOD" → same-day).
- **draft-clearing rule:** if the existing comm record has `comm.draft != null`, set
  `comm.draft = null` in this same write and note `"draft cleared — superseded by
  recruiter reply"`. This closes the ghost "Ready to send" panel that would otherwise
  persist after a new inbound message arrives on that thread.
- **Outcome-signal deferral:** before writing the comm status above, **peek at the
  outcome-signal classification** (STEP 7). If this thread will be handed to
  `track-outcomes` (rejected / offer / interview-advance), **do NOT write an
  intermediate `needs-reply` status** — hold the comm write, complete the
  `track-outcomes` hand-off, then write comm state **once** as a single atomic update
  (status, nextActionDue, comm.draft — all in one pass) after `track-outcomes` returns
  the resolved state. This prevents a ghost CTA between STEP 6 and STEP 7 completing.

Privacy invariant: `summary` and `artifactPath` content must never echo
`profile.compensation.current_base`. Outbound-safe comp fields are `expected_base`,
`target_base`, and `minimum_base` only.

If the user states a new gate mid-flow (e.g., "never follow up with this company",
"add them to excluded"), apply the write-back rule using this discriminator:

- **Write directly and report** (`Written to <file>: <key: value>`) when the change
  affects only the single application in scope (e.g., set `nextAction: none` on one
  record, add one company to `excluded_companies`).
- **Confirm first** when the change affects more than one application or has broad
  downstream effects (e.g., a comp floor change, adding a wildcard domain exclusion).

Route each gate type to its canonical file:
- Company exclusion → `candidate/targeting.yml#excluded_companies[]`
- Comp floor change → `candidate/profile.yml#compensation.minimum_base`
- Per-application follow-up pause → `workspace/tracker.json` (that record's
  `nextAction`/`nextActionDue`)

Then log each inbound thread to the Activity Pulse feed (the dashboard's live timeline — see **Activity Pulse** in AGENTS.md). One event per inbound thread captured, actor `world`:

```
npm run activity -- append --type message --actor world \
  --title "<Company> messaged" --summary "<one-line summary>" \
  --company "<Company>" --app-id <application id> --write
```

## STEP 7 — CLASSIFY OUTCOME SIGNALS

For each captured thread, scan the summaries for outcome signals:

- Rejection language → outcome label `rejected`
- Offer language → outcome label `offer`
- Interview advance / scheduling request → outcome label `interview-advance`

For any thread carrying one of these signals, **before** handing off: set
`comm.draft = null` on that record if a draft exists (draft is stale once an outcome
is known). Then hand off to `track-outcomes` with the `applicationId` and the outcome
label. Do not write `status` for those records before `track-outcomes` returns — wait
for the resolved state, then write comm and app in one atomic pass (status,
nextActionDue → null, comm.draft → null, messages[] append). The STEP 6 comm write
is **deferred** for outcome-carrying threads; `track-outcomes` owns the outcome write
and the final comm/app state is settled in that single pass.

Reply drafts are NOT this skill's job. If the user wants to reply to a DM, hand
off to `email-comms` — it is channel-aware for `linkedin` and `portal` and will
draft the response.

## STEP 8 — WRITE WATERMARK

For each platform successfully polled, upsert the following object into
`tracker.json`'s `sources[]` array:

LinkedIn:
```json
{
  "id": "linkedin-messages",
  "kind": "linkedin-messages",
  "name": "LinkedIn Messages",
  "lastRunAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp of now>"
}
```

Wellfound:
```json
{
  "id": "wellfound-messages",
  "kind": "wellfound-messages",
  "name": "Wellfound Messages",
  "lastRunAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp of now>"
}
```

If an entry with the matching `id` already exists, update only `lastRunAt`.
If no such entry exists, insert the full object.

Write the changes directly to `workspace/tracker.json`.

## STEP 9 — VERIFY + RE-RENDER

Run in sequence:

```bash
node src/cli/tracker.mjs --verify
```

Must exit 0. If it fails, do not proceed — show the validation errors and ask the
user how to resolve them.

```bash
node src/cli/tracker.mjs --followups
```

Confirm new threads appear in the follow-ups surface.

```bash
node src/cli/tracker.mjs --summary
```

Confirm message counts incremented for the matched applications.

```bash
node src/cli/tracker.mjs
```

Re-renders `workspace/tracker.html`.

Print a final ingest summary. The counts in this summary are agent-composed from
the running tallies kept during STEPS 4–7 — they are NOT parsed from CLI output
(the CLI commands above confirm schema validity and rendering only, and do not
emit these counts):

```
Ingest complete:
  Platforms polled:            N  (<platform list>)
  Threads scanned:             T  (linkedin: A, wellfound: B)
  Auto-skipped (marketing/non-recruiting):  S  (listed above, with reasons)
  Matched:                     M  (to K applications)
  Escalated unmatched:         U  (listed above — awaiting your match/skip)
  Handed to track-outcomes:    P  (application IDs: ...)
  Watermarks updated:          <linkedin lastRunAt>, <wellfound lastRunAt>
```

## RULES

- **Opt-in, OFF by default.** Only poll platforms where `npm run automation -- status --json`
  shows `messaging` `allowed: true` for that platform. The `allowed` field encodes the
  three-part AND (global switch · platform switch · ToS consent) from `mayRun()` in
  `src/core/automation/consent.mjs` — never re-derive the predicate in prose.

- **Highest ToS exposure — strongest consent gate.** In-platform messaging reads most
  directly risk a platform's terms of service. Consent must be deliberate: the user
  reads the platform ToS themselves and records it explicitly via the CLI. Surface this
  clearly; never downplay it.

- **Honor the Browser Automation Contract.** Follow AGENTS.md `## Browser Automation
  Contract` in full. The `mayRun()` predicate is the hard gate; if `allowed` is false,
  surface the reasons and stop — do not drive the browser.

- **Never run on a schedule or unattended.** Always user-initiated with the agent in
  the loop. Never invoke this skill automatically in response to a paste, a timer, or
  an upstream skill trigger.

- **Halt on auth challenges.** On captcha, 2FA prompt, login wall, or any unexpected
  interstitial, halt immediately and ask the user to resolve it. Never attempt to bypass
  or automate around an auth challenge.

- **Tool-agnostic browser prose.** Say "the session browser," "snapshot or read the
  page." Prefer the Chrome extension (it holds existing logins); fall back to Playwright
  with a one-time login pause (`~/.rolester/board-profiles/<platform>`). Never name an
  MCP namespace or vendor tool.

- **Local-only.** Message bodies, thread artifacts, and screenshots stay under
  `workspace/`. Nothing goes outbound. No credentials are stored — the session browser
  holds the logins.

- **Read-only on the platform.** This skill reads messages and captures them to the
  tracker. It does NOT send, reply to, react to, or otherwise mutate any in-platform
  message. Reply drafts belong to `email-comms` (channel-aware for `linkedin` and
  `portal`).

- **Outcome writes belong to `track-outcomes`.** Never write `status` directly for
  records carrying rejection / offer / interview-advance signals. Hand those to
  `track-outcomes` with the applicationId and label; it is the only writer of outcome
  state in `workspace/tracker.json`.

- **Privacy invariant.** Never write `current_base` into any `communications` field,
  message summary, or `workspace/comms/` artifact. Outbound-safe comp fields are
  `expected_base`, `target_base`, and `minimum_base` only.

- **Domain-neutral.** No hardcoded companies, roles, or candidate-specific values in
  this skill. No bracketed placeholder tokens anywhere — if a detail is unknown, omit
  it or go generic; never emit `[Company]`, `[Role]`, `[Name]`, or any bracket.
