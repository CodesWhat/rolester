description: When Rolester itself looks broken — a crash, stack trace, non-zero exit, or clearly-wrong output — diagnose it, assemble redacted diagnostics, and (only with the user's explicit yes) open a GitHub issue on the upstream Rolester repo.
---

# report-issue

> **Runs under AGENTS.md.** These contracts bind without being restated here: the Privacy Invariant (`current_base` and every piece of candidate PII never leave the machine), the Honesty Firewall (report what actually happened — never invent a repro or a symptom), and the Domain-Neutral Rule. Filing an issue is an **outbound publish to a public repo**: the per-invocation confirm-first gate and the redaction rules below are mandatory, not optional.

> **Agent voice.** Read `candidate/modes.yml#agent_voice` (default `standard`). `exec-summary` = one line ("found a bug in X — want me to file it?") then just the link; `standard` = short diagnosis + the rendered issue preview; `verbose` = full diagnostics before the preview.

## Core Principle

When Rolester breaks, the agent's job is three things: (1) tell a real defect apart from a user-config problem, (2) assemble a useful report that is **scrubbed of all personal data**, and (3) file it upstream **only after the user says yes**. This skill never auto-files, never runs on a schedule, and never puts candidate data in a public place. The issue is authored by the user's own `gh` identity, so their GitHub username is publicly attached to it — surface that before filing.

The report target is the upstream project tracker: **`CodesWhat/rolester`**. (A fork maintainer can change this slug.)

---

## When to Use

Offer this skill when something looks like a **Rolester defect**, not a user error:

- A `rolester` CLI command throws, prints a stack trace, or exits non-zero unexpectedly.
- A skill workflow hits a tool crash, an unhandled exception, or produces clearly-wrong output (a mangled artifact, a gate that scores impossibly, a dashboard that won't render).
- The user says "this is broken", "report a bug", "file an issue", "tell the devs", "this doesn't work", or "open a ticket".
- A reproducible failure survives the obvious fixes.

**Do NOT use it for** missing or invalid config, an un-ingested profile, a gate the user simply disagrees with, or a ToS/permission block — those route to `configure`, `ingest-profile`, or `rolester doctor`. Diagnose first; only escalate to an issue once you're confident it's a code defect, and say *why* you think so.

Offer, don't auto-run. The user opts in every time.

---

## STEP 1 — Confirm it's a bug, not a config problem

Run the cheap diagnostics and read the actual error before deciding anything:

```
rolester doctor
rolester --version
node --version
```

- If `doctor` flags missing config or schema drift → it's a setup issue. Route to `configure` or `ingest-profile`. Not an issue.
- If the failure is an unhandled exception, a stack trace into `src/`, or a reproducible wrong result from valid inputs → it's a real defect. Continue.

State your read out loud: "this looks like a Rolester bug because `<reason>`," or "this is a config issue, here's the fix." Don't file on a hunch.

---

## STEP 2 — Assemble REDACTED diagnostics

Build the report from these, and **redact every one** per the rules below:

| Field | Source | Redaction |
|---|---|---|
| Rolester version | `rolester --version` | none (safe) |
| Node + OS | `node --version`, `process.platform` | none (safe) |
| Install method | in-tree clone vs global npm | none (safe) |
| Failing command | the `rolester <cmd>` that broke | strip data args (names, paths, URLs) — keep the verb + flags |
| Error / stack trace | the thrown output | normalize home paths, drop any candidate data in the message |
| Expected vs actual | your diagnosis | generic phrasing, no candidate specifics |

**Redaction rules (hard — this is a PUBLIC repo):**

- **Never** include: candidate name, email, phone, location, `current_base` or any comp figure, employer or recruiter names, JD or tracker contents, or anything read from `candidate/` or `workspace/`.
- Rewrite absolute home paths `/Users/<name>/…` (or `/home/<name>/…`) → `~/…`, and workspace paths → `<workspace>/…`.
- Redact tokens, API keys, cookies, and any URL carrying a query-string secret.
- If a stack trace embeds a candidate value (e.g. a company name inside an error string), replace it with `<redacted>` — keep the shape of the error, drop the data.

When in doubt, leave it out. A vaguer-but-clean report beats a precise leak.

---

## STEP 3 — Dedup against existing issues

Search before filing so we don't pile on duplicates:

```
gh issue list --repo CodesWhat/rolester --state open --search "<short error signature>"
```

If a matching open issue exists, offer to **add a comment** with the user's redacted repro instead of opening a new one. Only open a fresh issue when nothing matches.

---

## STEP 4 — Render the issue and get explicit consent

Build the title + body from this template, then **show the user the exact rendered text** and ask for a yes:

```
Title: <one-line summary of the failure>

### Environment
- Rolester: <version>
- Node: <version>  •  OS: <platform>
- Install: <in-tree | global npm>

### What happened
<one or two sentences>

### Steps to reproduce
1. <redacted command / action>
2. …

### Expected
<what should have happened>

### Actual
<what happened, with the redacted error / stack trace fenced below>

​```
<fenced, redacted stack trace>
​```

---
_Filed via the Rolester `report-issue` skill. Diagnostics were redacted of personal data._
```

Tell the user plainly: "this posts publicly to CodesWhat/rolester under your GitHub account (`<gh username>`)." Get an explicit **yes** before filing. Nothing publishes without it.

---

## STEP 5 — File it

Try `gh` first (the user's authenticated path):

```
gh auth status                        # confirm authed; if not, use the fallback
gh issue create --repo CodesWhat/rolester \
  --title "<title>" --body-file <redacted-body-file> --label bug
```

- On success, give the user the returned issue URL and confirm it's live (fetch it back if useful).
- Drop `--label bug` if the repo doesn't carry that label (the create fails on an unknown label).
- **Fallback (no `gh`, or not authed):** build a prefilled URL — `https://github.com/CodesWhat/rolester/issues/new?title=<enc>&body=<enc>&labels=bug` — and hand it to the user to open. If the body is too long for a URL, print the redacted body for them to paste instead. Never block: the user always gets a one-click or one-paste path.

---

## STEP 6 — Report back

Give the user the issue URL (or the prefilled link) and a one-line confirmation of what was filed. This is a tooling action, not a job-search event — do **not** write any candidate-record state or Activity Pulse entry for it.

---

## Rules

- **Confirm-first, always.** The rendered issue is shown and approved before anything posts. Never auto-file.
- **Redact ruthlessly.** No candidate PII, comp, employer/recruiter names, or workspace contents in a public issue. Normalize home paths. When unsure, drop it.
- **Bug, not config.** Diagnose first; route setup and permission problems to `configure` / `doctor`, never the issue tracker.
- **The user's identity is public.** The issue is authored by their `gh` account — say so before filing.
- **Dedup.** Search open issues first; prefer commenting on a match over opening a duplicate.
- **Never block.** If `gh` isn't available, fall back to a prefilled URL or a paste-ready body. The user always has a path.
- **Domain-neutral.** The only hardcoded value is the upstream repo slug (`CodesWhat/rolester`); everything else is gathered at runtime.
- **Local-first.** Diagnostics are gathered locally; nothing leaves the machine except the single approved issue.
