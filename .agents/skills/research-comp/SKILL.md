# research-comp

Benchmark market compensation for a role+location via web search. Produces a cited `workspace/research/comp-bench-<role-slug>-<loc-slug>-<yyyy-mm>.md` artifact, emits a COMP BENCHMARK addendum block (when invoked from `evaluate-job`), and proposes — never auto-applies — gate write-backs when market data shows candidate targets are misaligned.

> **Runs under AGENTS.md.** These contracts bind without being restated here: Privacy Invariant (`current_base` never outbound), Honesty Firewall, Placeholder/Bracket Ban, Gate Write-back, Domain-Neutral Rule, Browser Automation Contract, Activity Pulse logging, Tracker verify+re-render, and Sent-Clears-Draft. Inline reminders at point-of-use are intentional; standalone restatements point back to the relevant AGENTS.md section.

> **Agent voice.** Read `candidate/modes.yml#agent_voice` (default `standard`) before producing the comp benchmark summary. Apply the register from AGENTS.md#mode-switches. The benchmark artifact is always written in full — register governs the in-chat presentation: `exec-summary` = floor/midpoint/ceiling numbers + 1-line confidence note; `standard` = scannable table of sources + band + alignment note; `technical` = per-source analysis + confidence rationale; `verbose` = full artifact + sourcing discussion.

## Inputs

| Source | Fields read |
| --- | --- |
| `candidate/profile.yml` | `compensation.minimum_base`, `compensation.target_base`, `compensation.expected_base`, `compensation.oe_min_base`, `compensation.oe_max_base`, `location.home`, `candidate.domain` — **NEVER `compensation.current_base`** |
| `candidate/targeting.yml` | `role_buckets[]` (role family, priority) |
| Active job file `workspace/jobs/*.md` | `role`, `location`, `company` (when invoked from `evaluate-job`) |
| `workspace/research/<company>.md` | Company-size tier (if present; used to calibrate level/band) |

---

## STEP 0 — Load config

Read `candidate/profile.yml`. Extract:

- `compensation.minimum_base` — the comp floor for below-floor comparisons.
- `compensation.target_base` — the comp target for above/at/below comparisons.
- `compensation.expected_base`, `compensation.oe_min_base`, `compensation.oe_max_base` — for context only; do not emit these in the artifact.
- `candidate.domain` — used in STEP 2 to select domain-appropriate sources.
- `location.home` — fallback market when no job-frontmatter location is available.

**Never read `compensation.current_base`.** It is a private gate input and must be absent from every artifact, emitted line, and draft this skill produces.

Then check usage mode:

```
rolester modes allows research:comp
```

If it returns `downshift`, use one credible source or a non-stale existing benchmark
before doing a full multi-source sweep, and say that lean usage mode caused the lighter
path. If it returns `skip`, stop unless the user explicitly overrides. If it returns
`run`, continue normally.

---

## STEP 1 — Resolve benchmark parameters

Determine the four parameters that define this benchmark:

1. **Role title** — from the active job frontmatter (`role:` field) if invoked from `evaluate-job`; otherwise from `candidate/targeting.yml#role_buckets[]` (highest-priority bucket). If ambiguous, ask.
2. **Location / market** — from the active job frontmatter (`location:` field); fall back to `profile.yml#location.home`. Normalize to a market slug (e.g. `san-francisco-ca`, `remote-us`, `new-york-ny`).
3. **Level / seniority** — infer from the role title (e.g., "Senior", "Staff", "Director"). Note if unclear.
4. **Company-size tier** — if `workspace/research/<company>.md` exists, read it for headcount/stage; otherwise note "tier unknown".

Derive the artifact stem:

```
comp-bench-<role-slug>-<loc-slug>-<yyyy-mm>
```

where `<yyyy-mm>` is today's year-month (ISO).

---

## STEP 2 — WebSearch market comp (≥3 distinct sources)

**[DELEGATE: subagent]** Source gathering parallelizes — fan out subagents across the
domain-appropriate sources (parallel `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`, no one-browser limit), each
returning its recorded data points (`{source, url, title, fetchedISO, dataPoints:[…], confidence}`).
The orchestrator already cleared STEP 0's mode/privacy gate; subagents do not re-gate, read
AGENTS.md, or write files. Collect every returned point before STEP 3 — the percentile
synthesis needs the full set. Degrade to inline sequential search when no subagent primitive
exists. See the **Delegation Contract** in AGENTS.md.

Use `WebSearch` to gather market compensation data. Select sources appropriate to `profile.yml#candidate.domain`:

- **Tech / software** — levels.fyi, Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary, Blind, Comprehensive.io, Radford/Aon survey summaries, Dice, Indeed.
- **Finance / consulting** — Management Consulted, Wall Street Oasis, Glassdoor, 10x Management, BLS Occupational Outlook, LinkedIn Salary.
- **Healthcare / clinical** — MGMA, AMN Healthcare, Indeed, Glassdoor, BLS.
- **Creative / marketing** — Glassdoor, LinkedIn Salary, AAF/ANA salary surveys, Indeed, Robert Half Creative.
- **Other domains** — prefer Glassdoor + LinkedIn Salary + one trade-association or BLS-linked source.

Do not default to levels.fyi when `candidate.domain` is not tech; a bare assumption that every candidate is a software engineer is wrong.

**Per source, record:**
- URL
- Title / publication
- Fetched date (today ISO)
- Cited data point(s): floor, midpoint, ceiling or band (annotate with level/location qualifier)
- Confidence: `high` (primary salary database or verified survey), `med` (community self-report or aggregated reviews), `low` (anecdotal, thin sample, or older than 18 months)

Minimum 3 distinct sources. If fewer than 3 distinct sources exist for this role+location, note "insufficient public data for `<role>` in `<location>`" rather than guessing.

---

## STEP 3 — Synthesize the benchmark range

From the gathered data points derive:

- **`floor`** — 25th-percentile or lowest credible band floor across sources (null if insufficient data).
- **`midpoint`** — 50th-percentile or median across sources (null if insufficient data).
- **`ceiling`** — 75th-percentile or highest credible band ceiling across sources (null if insufficient data).
- **`currency`** — `"USD"` unless the market is non-US (use appropriate ISO code).
- **`confidence`** — `high` if ≥2 high-confidence sources agree within 15%; `med` if sources broadly agree but differ or are self-report; `low` if only 1 source or high disagreement.

**Conflict rule:** when sources disagree by more than 20% on the midpoint, do not silently average. Show a RANGE-OF-RANGES and mark each figure `[CONFLICT: source A says $X–$Y; source B says $P–$Q]`. Pick the range of ranges as the synthesized band and set `confidence: low`.

**Sparse data rule:** if fewer than 3 usable data points were found, write "insufficient public data for `<role>` in `<location>`" in the artifact body. Set `floor`, `midpoint`, and `ceiling` to `null` and `confidence: low`. Do not guess.

---

## STEP 4 — Compose the artifact draft

Write the following to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp/comp-bench-draft.md`). Every market figure must carry a source marker with a colon: `[source: "Title" (https://url), fetched <ISO>, confidence: high|med|low]`. Markdown links (`[Title](url)`) are also acceptable. A bare bracket marker with no colon is citation residue and will be refused by `record`.

```markdown
---
type: comp-benchmark
role: "<role title>"
role_slug: "<slug>"
location: "<market/location>"
company: "<company if role-at-company, else null>"
fetchedAt: "<today ISO>"
staleness_days: 30
sources:
  - url: "https://..."
    title: "..."
    fetchedAt: "<ISO>"
    confidence: high|med|low
benchmark:
  floor: <number or null>
  midpoint: <number or null>
  ceiling: <number or null>
  currency: "USD"
  confidence: high|med|low
---

## Market range

<Synthesized floor / midpoint / ceiling with citation markers per figure. Show RANGE-OF-RANGES and CONFLICT markers where applicable.>

## Sources & method

<For each source: URL, title, date fetched, data points extracted, confidence level. At least 3 entries, each with a citation marker. Note any source conflicts explicitly.>

## vs. candidate targets

<Compare market floor/midpoint/ceiling against profile.minimum_base and profile.target_base only. State "above / at / below" for each. Never print the candidate's current_base or any dollar figure attributed to their current compensation.>

## Open questions

<Unresolved items: level ambiguity, location cost-of-living adjustment needed, company-size tier unknown, thin data, etc.>

## Privacy Note

Market data only; no private candidate compensation inputs are present in this artifact.
```

**Do not write `current_base` anywhere in the draft.** The `record` guard refuses a literal `current_base` token; also refuse to print the candidate's current-compensation number in the "vs. candidate targets" section — compare against `minimum_base` and `target_base` only.

---

## STEP 5 — Record the artifact

**Dry-run first** (validates frontmatter, ≥1 cited source, placeholder lint, `current_base` guard):

```
rolester research record "<role title>" --name comp-bench-<role-slug>-<loc-slug>-<yyyy-mm> --file /tmp/comp-bench-draft.md
```

Inspect the dry-run output. If `record` reports any refusal (missing citation, placeholder bracket, `current_base` token, missing required frontmatter), fix the draft and re-run dry.

**Commit when clean:**

```
rolester research record "<role title>" --name comp-bench-<role-slug>-<loc-slug>-<yyyy-mm> --file /tmp/comp-bench-draft.md --write
```

Log the benchmark to the Activity Pulse feed (see **Activity Pulse** in AGENTS.md). The summary describes market data only — never the candidate's current compensation:

```
rolester activity append --type research --actor agent \
  --title "Comp benchmark — <Role> (<location>)" --summary "<floor / midpoint / ceiling synthesized>" \
  --role "<Role>" --write
```

After `--write` succeeds, delete the temp draft:

```
rm /tmp/comp-bench-draft.md
```

The canonical artifact lands at:

```
workspace/research/comp-bench-<role-slug>-<loc-slug>-<yyyy-mm>.md
```

`record` is the **only** write path. Never write the canonical file directly.

---

## STEP 6 — Emit COMP BENCHMARK addendum (when invoked from evaluate-job)

When this skill is called from `evaluate-job` STEP 5 (COMP CHECK) or STEP 7 (COMP ANCHOR), emit the following block immediately after STEP 5 completes, so evaluate-job can incorporate it into its COMP and COMP ANCHOR verdicts:

```text
COMP BENCHMARK (market data, cited):
  Floor: $<N>  Mid: $<N>  Ceiling: $<N>  [confidence: <level>]
  Sources: <N> — workspace/research/comp-bench-<stem>.md
  vs profile.minimum_base: <above/at/below>   vs profile.target_base: <above/at/below>
```

If data was insufficient, emit:

```text
COMP BENCHMARK: insufficient public data for <role> in <location> — workspace/research/comp-bench-<stem>.md
```

When not invoked from `evaluate-job` (standalone run), emit the same block as a top-level output line.

**Negotiation data handoff:** the `benchmark.floor`, `benchmark.midpoint`, and `benchmark.ceiling` values in the canonical artifact (`workspace/research/comp-bench-<stem>.md`) are the cited market evidence consumed by the Negotiation Contract in `AGENTS.md`. The band powers two downstream uses: (1) the geographic-discount rebuttal, where the ROLE market midpoint rebuts a locale-discounted offer — `benchmark.floor` is used only when the offer is already above midpoint and the gap is narrow; `benchmark.ceiling` only when the role scope matches the top of the benchmarked band and the artifact explicitly supports it; default to midpoint; (2) the opening anchor for multi-round sequencing, cross-checked against `profile.compensation.target_base`. Skills that invoke negotiation logic must read `benchmark.*` from this artifact directly; they must not invent or estimate market figures. If no artifact exists for the role, they must run `research-comp` first rather than citing any number.

---

## STEP 7 — Confirm-first gate write-back proposal

When the market benchmark reveals that `profile.minimum_base` or `profile.target_base` is materially misaligned with market (e.g., floor is well above or below minimum_base, midpoint diverges from target_base by more than 15%), propose — never auto-run — the appropriate gate command:

```text
GATE PROPOSAL (confirm to apply):
  Market mid ($<N>) is <above|below> profile.target_base by ~<pct>%.
  To update the comp floor:   rolester gate comp-floor <N>
  To update the comp target:  rolester gate comp-target <N>
  Run with --write --confirm to commit. Do not auto-apply.
```

Show both commands only when both are misaligned. Show neither when the market and profile targets are in range. Never invoke `rolester gate` automatically — only propose the commands.

---

## Required Output

**Standalone run:**

```text
COMP BENCHMARK (market data, cited):
  Floor: $<N>  Mid: $<N>  Ceiling: $<N>  [confidence: <level>]
  Sources: <N> — workspace/research/comp-bench-<stem>.md
  vs profile.minimum_base: <above/at/below>   vs profile.target_base: <above/at/below>
[GATE PROPOSAL block — only when misaligned]
```

**When invoked from evaluate-job:** emit the COMP BENCHMARK block between evaluate-job STEP 5 and STEP 7 so the calling skill can use the market data in its COMP and COMP ANCHOR verdicts.

---

## Privacy Invariant

> See **Gates › Privacy invariant (hard)** in AGENTS.md. Short form: `current_base` never appears in any emitted line, artifact draft, canonical research file, or gate proposal; outbound comp comparisons use `minimum_base` and `target_base` only.

---

## Citation & conflict rules

- Every market figure in the artifact body carries a source marker with a colon: `[source: "Title" (https://url), fetched <ISO>, confidence: high|med|low]`. Markdown links are also acceptable.
- A bare bracket marker with no colon (e.g., `[levels.fyi]`) is refused as placeholder residue.
- Conflicting ranges → show a RANGE-OF-RANGES with all sources, never silently average; mark `[CONFLICT: ...]`.
- Sparse data (fewer than 3 usable data points) → write "insufficient public data for `<role>` in `<location>`"; set `floor`/`midpoint`/`ceiling` to `null`; set `confidence: low`.

---

## Domain-neutrality rule

Source selection is driven by `profile.yml#candidate.domain` + the role title (STEP 2). Never assume the candidate is in tech. levels.fyi is appropriate only when `candidate.domain` is tech or software; for all other domains use domain-appropriate salary databases, industry surveys, or BLS-linked sources.
