// status-map.mjs — normalize a raw ATS-portal status string into the tracker's
// canonical status vocabulary, and classify a status change as a transition.
//
// Phase 1 (status polling) scrapes free-form status labels off candidate ATS
// dashboards ("Application under review", "We've decided to move forward with other
// candidates", "Offer extended"). Those have to land on the SAME canonical statuses
// the rest of the system understands before track-outcomes can act on them. This
// module is that mapping — the browser-side analog of the dashboard's classifyStage
// keyword ladder, but emitting a value in VALID_APP_STATUSES.
//
// It drives no browser and writes nothing: pure string → status. The sync-status
// skill scrapes the labels (agent-driven) and hands HIGH-confidence transitions to
// track-outcomes (still the only writer of tracker.json). LOW-confidence (defaulted)
// results are surfaced for human confirmation, never auto-applied.

// Ordered keyword rules: first match wins. Raw ATS phrasing → a canonical tracker
// status (every right-hand value must be in VALID_APP_STATUSES — asserted below).

// Ordering is load-bearing: terminal/negative phrasings are checked BEFORE the
// positive stages so "no longer under consideration" → rejected (not "consideration"
// → awaiting) and "we are unable to offer you the role" → rejected (not "offer").
